#Elevator pitch

The Mudramum website will provide an online reference for people interested in energetic and physical healing through the practice of hand mudras. Mudramum aims to be fun and easy to use, like asking your mum or a friend for casual advice about a particular health concern. Therapists who suggest mudras for their clients could use the site as a resource and link to it from their business sites.

#Brief

##Background

Hand mudras are of ancient origin and are found worldwide. They are associated with many traditions, from yoga to classical Indian dance.

There are dozens of mudras that can be used for healing body, mind, and spirit. Because of the breadth and complexity of the subject, current references can be either simplistic or require study and extensive reading. Many resources are dated in appearance.

##Purpose

The Mudramum website aims to make choosing and practicing a mudra easy. The purpose is to be informative and playful at the same time, without going into extensive detail. The site will be modern, beautiful, and engaging.

The site will also function as a handy memory aid for repeat visitors. It will help users remember not only what mudra to use for a particular issue (for example, asthma), but also the precise hand positions, the suggested frequency, and the duration to hold the posture.

Future potential features:

* development of original art (cards or posters)

* links to reference books on Amazon.com.

##Audience

People who would be interested in using mudras are likely to be acquainted with one or more alternative healing modalities including Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupressure, Reiki, yoga, or EFT. They may be of all ages and genders.

People would access the site through a desktop browser or a mobile (phone or tablet) device.

Therapists report that their clients often forget the mudras they have suggested or don't have access to the popular books. They would like to link to the Mudramum site from their business websites.

A psychologist who treats sleep disorders: "I'd like [to recommend] mudras for different emotional states, either to enhance or to lower emotions or cognitive focus."
